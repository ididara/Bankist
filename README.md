# Bankist
Bankist - small bank app from course
App created like it was a bank application where you can transfer money, loan money and close your account. HTML and CSS were premade by course owner, and JS was created also by course owner, but with me following his instructions and fully understanding what is everything about.
Main things you can do in app: login as 4 different users, transfer money between them and making it visible immidiately on their accounts, loan money from the bank, have your account closed.
All transactions are visible by date and amount. There is a whole balance of incomes, outcomes and interest which applyes depending on the incomea mounts, with different interest rate for each account.
Every login has username and password and getes logged out after 2 minutes of inactivity
At every login it is visible date and hour of the present time.
